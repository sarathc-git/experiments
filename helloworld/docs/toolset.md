# Opinionated implementation of Event Driven Microservices

## Introduction

    This project is an opiniated effort to document best practices in building production quality, developer friendly, microservices with event driven systems.

    Over the past many years, I have been amazed at the power of event driven microservices. At Airtel payments bank we have adopted this architectural pattern to build very high scale infrastructrue, handling over a couple of 10s of Millions of transactions per day. 

    This journey has also been interesting in how the teams adopted this paradigm and progressed on this journey.

    This project is an effort to highlight the various decisions, challenges and learnings in building effective event driven microservices. At this point this project is based on JAVA and spring boot, but the intent is to build this for multiple languages and also bring in polyglot capabilities. 

## Goals

### Developer Experience

### REST Best Practices

### Testing Best Practices

### Security practices

### Cloud native tool set for full lifecycle simplicity
